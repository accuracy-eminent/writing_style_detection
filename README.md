# Writing Style Detection with Machine Learning

Many historical documents exist with no known author, or have a list of possible authors with no one clear candidate.
Stylometry, or writing style analysis, can solve this problem.
Various metrics can be calculated, such as word length, sentence length, and frequency of n-grams (strings of n words), 
and richness of vocabulary can be used to establish a style of an author that can be statistically differentiated from 
the authors. By finding the text where the stylistic metrics match closest to an author, we can estimate who wrote the text.
